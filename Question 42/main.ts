// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

const magicianNames: string[] = [
  "Harry Porter",
  "David Copperfield",
  "Hermione Granger",
  "Professor Albus Dumbledore",
  "Ron Weasley",
];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
  for (const magician of magicians) {
    console.log(magician);
  }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
  const greatMagicians: string[] = magicians.map(
    (magician) => `the Great ${magician}`
  );
  return greatMagicians;
}

const greatMagicianNames: string[] = make_great(magicianNames);
console.log("\nGreat Magicians:");
show_magicians(greatMagicianNames);
